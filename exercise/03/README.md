# Part 3

Teaching module:

- Functions
- Control flow: loops (while and for)

## Exercise 1: math.js

Same as part 1 exercise 3, there are three functions called `sum`, `average`, and `multiply` that you need to modify in order to give the correct answer. Do not modify function `main`.

```sh
$ node math.js
First number: 12
Second number: 3
# Your output
Sum: 15
Average: 7.5
Multiply: 36
```

```sh
$ node math.js
First number: 4.2
Second number: 2
# Your output
Sum: 6.2
Average: 3.1
Multiply: 8.4
```
